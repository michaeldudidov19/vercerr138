                Life has taught me that respect, caring and love must be shared, for it&#039;s. We care about all kinds of things, from our families and friends, to our careers and social issues. When someone doesn&#039;t care about you, it&#039;s about their insecurities and limitations and has nothing to do with your worth.

    <h3>Quotes on parents&#039; love and care.</h3>
    <p>Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. Simply tell them that you are moving on, and you didn&#039;t care about it anymore. You are losing out the bright side if you are doing so. When someone doesn&#039;t care about you, it&#039;s about their insecurities and limitations and has nothing to do with your worth.</p>
