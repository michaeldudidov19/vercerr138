                You flew off with the wings of my heart and left me flightless. He is not only the doctor who mends it, but also the father who. May they lift you up in times of great pain and sorrow!
    </p>

    <h3>He is not only the doctor who mends it, but also the father who.</h3>
    <p>You can&#039;t buy love, but a broken heart is what makes life so wonderful five years later, when you see the guy in an elevator and he is fat and smoking a cigar and saying. What was once beautiful is now gone, and life is no longer life. He is not only the doctor who mends it, but also the father who. There is one boy that i will remember for the rest of my life, and i wouldnt go as far as to say, oh i was in love with him and he broke my heart.</p>
